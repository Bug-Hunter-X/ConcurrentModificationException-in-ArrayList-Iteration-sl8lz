# ConcurrentModificationException in Java
This repository demonstrates a common Java error: ConcurrentModificationException.  The example shows how attempting to modify a collection while iterating over it with a for-each loop causes this exception.  The solution provides a safer approach using an Iterator.

## Running the code
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Compile and run the `ConcurrentModificationExceptionExample.java` file. You will observe the exception.
3.  Run `ConcurrentModificationExceptionSolution.java` to see the corrected approach.
